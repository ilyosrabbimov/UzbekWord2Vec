<h1>Word Embeddings for Uzbek Language</h1>
<hr>
This repository consists of two word embeddings which Uzbek Word2Vec CBOW and Skip-Gram 300-dimensions word embeddings.
The Gensim library was used to create the word vector models using CBOW and Skip-Gram algorithms. 
Training parameters: dimension 300, the window size of 5, learning rate 0.025, min count 1, and 10 negatives for both CBOW and Skip-Gram models.
